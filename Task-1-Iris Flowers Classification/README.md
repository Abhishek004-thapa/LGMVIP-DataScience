# Iris-Flower-Classification Using Various Machine Learning Algorithms along with detailed Documentation.

## `Dataset from :` https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshid/iris-flower-dataset

### Algorithms Used in this project:

    1) Logistic Regression   
    2) K-Nearest Neighbours   
    3) Support Vector Classifier(SVC)    
    4) Naive Bayesian Classifier    
    5) Decision Tree  
    6) Random Forest

## `Abstract :` 
This project is based on multiclass classification problems which is accomplished using following
various machine learning algorithms:

    1) Logistic Regression   
    2) K-Nearest Neighbours   
    3) Support Vector Classifier(SVC)    
    4) Naive Bayesian Classifier    
    5) Decision Tree  
    6) Random Forest
    
3 classes of Iris flowers family:

    i) Iris Setosa
    ii) Iris Verginica
    iii) Iris Versicolor
are classified based on the `sepal and petal's length and width`
