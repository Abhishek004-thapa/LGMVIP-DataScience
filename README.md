# Task no 03 -- IMAGE TO PENCIL SKETCH USING PYTHON - OpenCV

This project is one of the simplest python project. Image can be converted into Pencil Sketch with just 10 to 12 lines of Codes. So, Just give your hour with a cup of coffee to explore this project.
It is based on Image Manipulation using Python Library known as OpenCV i.e. Open Computer Vision. OpenCV-Python is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems.

   ### `STEPS`:
      
      1) Importing Libraries cv2 & matplotlib.pyplot
      2) Loading Original Image.
      3) Converting BGR into Gray Scale Image.
      4) Inverting Gray Scaled Image.
      5) Bluring Inverted Image.
      6) Inverting Blurred Image.
      7) Generating Pencil Sketch Image.
      8) Saving and loading image.
      9) Visualization  in a Single Frame
 

### `Image used for sketch in this project :`

It is of Shrinkhala Khatiwada who is a Nepalese model and Miss Nepal 2018.
She represented Nepal in Miss World 2018.
